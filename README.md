The project is based on travel agency idea. The Agency is called Dream Travel.
The name originates from the idea of giving people a dream experience through affordable packages to their dream destinations.

The project is a landing page built using Bootstrap components.
On each section I have met various criterias;

    Navbar:
        It has the agency's name on the left and the rest of the menu on the right.
        The details on the right have a different color from those on the right to allow them to stand out.
        The navbar is based on hamburger design to allow it to collapse in smaller screens.

    Hero Section:
        Designed with a scenic travel destination image of a waterfall with a lake-like background to capture ones breath.
        A heading, a subheading, and a prominent call-to-action button are placed at the center with different colors and font sizes.

    Destinations Section:
        A grid layout was used to showcase offers of travel destinations.
        The designs involves a card with an image, title, description, and a "Learn More" button.

    Tours Section:
        Bootstrap's accordion component are used to showcase different tour packages.
        Each package has a title, a brief description, and a "View Details" link.

    Contact Form:
        The contact form was created with section on firstname, lastname, phone number, email, destination of interest, and a message box.

    Footer:
        The footer has the conpany name, copyright information and social media icons.

Requirements:

As per instructions the project has Bootstrap components such as the navbar, jumbotron, cards, accordion, and form elements.
